| Redis provider for managing tokens

|
| Uses Redis for managing tokens. We recommend using the "redis" driver
| over the "database" driver when the tokens based auth is the
| primary authentication mode.
|
| Redis ensure that all the expired tokens gets cleaned up automatically.
| Whereas with SQL, you have to cleanup expired tokens manually.
|
| The foreignKey column is used to make the relationship between the user
| and the token. You are free to use any column name here.
